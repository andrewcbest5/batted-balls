I wanted to do something different from my last project with this dataset and not repeat the same visuals and tables I had:

My primary goal was to make an application that is more useful and puts the data into a context that can be used to draw insights from. I wanted to build a player report that would give you all sorts of stats, information, and visuals of that player. 

I also wanted to use a more framework that is more involved, more used in industry, and more compatible with API/database/cloud services (although not used in this project). RShiny is great, but most everything is built for you, so I wanted to show off some web development skills. I built this app in Angular. 

I had lots of ideas, but with the time constraints and all the work that it takes to get an Angular project running, I ended up giving some basic stats that show, roughly, how well the batter has been hitting the ball, and to what parts of the field the batter usually hits the ball. 

With more time, I would have added more styling to make it more visualy appealing. I also wanted to create some spray charts, heat maps, etc, using chart.js or d3, but I did not get to that.
